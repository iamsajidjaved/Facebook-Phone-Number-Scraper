# Facebook Contact Extractor Icons

Since this is a development version, you'll need to add your own icon files.

Create these icon files in the icons/ directory:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons or use any PNG files of the appropriate sizes.

For a quick solution, you can:
1. Create a simple square colored image in any image editor
2. Save it in different sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Name them appropriately

The extension will work without icons, but having them makes it look more professional.

Suggested icon design:
- Blue background (#1877f2 - Facebook blue)
- White text/symbol (like "CE" for Contact Extractor)
- Simple, recognizable design
